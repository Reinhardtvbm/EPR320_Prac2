# EPR320 Practical 2: Prototypes and Developmental Tests
## Reinhardt von Brandis-Martini

### Microcontroller: PIC18F45K22

### Language: C99 (Embedded C)

### Started on 3 September 2022

### Finished on < to be added >

### Decription
First implementation for an algorithm that navigated an autonomous robot through a maze, called the NAVCON. Uses the onboard USART of a PIC18 to communicate with a sensor subsystem to for input to the algorithm and outputs control actions to a motor subsystem.
